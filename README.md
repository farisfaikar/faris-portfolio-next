# Faris Faikar's Portfolio!

I am a Full Stack Engineer specializing in Website Development, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. With extensive experience in Full Stack Development — primarily using tech stacks such as Laravel and Next.js — through freelancing projects, internships, and professional work, I am building my career toward becoming a Software Engineer and eventually a Tech Lead.

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
